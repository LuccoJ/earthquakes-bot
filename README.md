# Brainstorm earthquake and emergency alert bot

This is the earthquake early warning and reporting bot known as Brainstorm on IRC, BrainstormBot on Twitter and u/BrainstormBot on Reddit.

See https://www.reddit.com/r/EEW/wiki/index for a general introduction.

The code provided here is by no means ready-to-run and requires outdated tools (Python 2.7 and the Poetry version to go with it) as well as possibly some modules that I haven't been able to provide as they have too many internal dependencies.
It is very scarcely documented in terms of comments.

As a whole, it depends on an IRC bot core to run, even though it sends messages to many more places than just IRC. Bot cores of the "Phenny" family may work with or without modifications to this code.
